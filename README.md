# rfetch
pfetch clone written in rust.
it's meant to be cross platform, there will be a windows build once I figured out how to get the current user on all platforms.

example output:
```zsh
$ /rfetch
janek@core
os        Arch Linux
uptime    1d 1h 50m 48s
cpu       AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics
kernel    5.14.14-arch1-1
memory    3864 MB / 16106 MB
```
